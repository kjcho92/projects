Certainly! Let's tailor the scenarios to the specific characteristics of the Telco Customer Churn dataset:

### Scenario 1: Markdown Folding (0:30 - 1:00)
- **Scenario:**
  - You have a detailed markdown cell describing various features of the Telco Customer Churn dataset, including customer demographics, services, and churn metrics.
- **Demo:**
  - Show the initial markdown cell with an overview.
  - Fold and unfold sections to gradually reveal details about customer demographics, subscribed services, and key churn metrics.

```python
# Markdown cell example
```

### Scenario 2: Side by Side View (1:00 - 1:45)
- **Scenario:**
  - You're exploring a code cell that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer tenure and want to observe the changes immediately.
- **Demo:**
  - Run an EDA code cell on customer tenure.
  - Split the view horizontally to simultaneously display the EDA code and the resulting visualizations, such as histograms and trends.

```python
# EDA code cell example for customer tenure
```

### Scenario 3: Resize Outputs (1:45 - 2:15)
- **Scenario:**
  - You have generated visualizations showing the distribution of monthly charges and total charges, but the output is extensive.
- **Demo:**
  - Run a cell generating visualizations for monthly charges and total charges.
  - Resize the output to focus on specific charts, such as the distribution of monthly charges for churned and non-churned customers.

```python
# Visualization example
```

### Scenario 4: Navigate to the Selected Cell (2:15 - 2:45)
- **Scenario:**
  - You're reviewing customer satisfaction metrics in one part of the notebook and want to quickly navigate to another section discussing customer service interactions.
- **Demo:**
  - Use keyboard shortcuts (`Up Arrow` and `Down Arrow`) to navigate between cells, highlighting sections related to customer satisfaction metrics and customer service interactions.

```python
# Navigation example
```

### Scenario 5: Show Line Numbers (2:45 - 3:15)
- **Scenario:**
  - You're collaborating with a data scientist who is reviewing your code for predicting churn, and you want to discuss specific lines.
- **Demo:**
  - Show a code cell with line numbers turned off.
  - Enable line numbers in the text editor settings to make collaborative discussions more precise, especially in the context of machine learning model development.

```python
# Show line numbers example
```

### Scenario 6: Coediting and Widget Coediting (3:15 - 4:00)
- **Scenario:**
  - You're working on fine-tuning a machine learning model with a team, and you want to see real-time changes to hyperparameter values.
- **Demo:**
  - Collaboratively adjust hyperparameter values using widgets in real-time, showing how different configurations affect the model's performance on predicting customer churn.

```python
# Widget example for hyperparameter tuning
```

### Closing Slide (4:00 - 4:15)
- **Script:**
  - "In conclusion, these Jupyter Notebook features are invaluable when working with real-world datasets like the Telco Customer Churn dataset. Apply them to your own data exploration and model development. Thank you for joining today's exploration, and I'm here for any questions or discussions!"

Feel free to adapt the scenarios and script based on your preferences and the specific content of your notebook.
